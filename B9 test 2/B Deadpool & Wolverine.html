          With the months of buildup for “Deadpool & Wolverine,” it’s hard to
          believe that the movie is finally out in theaters. Much of that hype,
          of course, had to do with speculation around who would cameo in the
          threequel, which doubles as a belated, warts-and-all love letter to
          the now-defunct 20th Century Fox universe of Marvel superheroes before
          that studio got absorbed by Disney in 2019. While that speculation ran
          the gamut from perceived hints in Taylor Swift’s latest album to Halle
          Berry’s Storm-like haircut on Instagram, the four biggest cameos
          actually in the movie are so unexpected – and so out there – they are
          sure not to disappoint.</p> <p>Here is a breakdown of the quartet of
          characters that Ryan Reynolds’s Deadpool and Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine
          come across in their big budget, irreverent comic book tentpole: Chris
          Evans… but not as Captain America Chris Evans in "Fantastic Four -
          Rise Of The Silver Surfer" from 2007. Chris Evans in "Fantastic Four -
          Rise Of The Silver Surfer" from 2007. 20th Century</p>
          <p>Fox/Marvel/Kobal/Shutterstock In one of the most gleefully shocking
          interludes in “Deadpool & Wolverine,” the titular superduo cross paths
          with a storied hero previously portrayed by Chris Evans when they end
          up in the Void – an outer-dimensional garbage dump that quite
          literally holds the “trash” of 20th Century Fox and Marvel’s past (and
          failed) comic book outings. After a setup earlier in the film which
          presents Reynolds’ Wade Wilson/Deadpool as an aspiring would-be
          Avenger, he immediately gets excited to see Evans and expects him to
          utter the famous catchphrase seen in 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame” (which
          is, of course, “Avengers, assemble!”). Instead, Evans declares, “Flame
          on!” and proceeds to burst into flame and fly through the sky, thereby
          resurrecting his previous comic book character Johnny Storm a.k.a. The
          Human Torch from 2005’s “Fantastic Four” and the sequel two years
          later. What follows is completely insane, and gory, which is a
          perfectly fitting combination for a Deadpool movie. Wesley Snipes as

          Toro. Wesley Snipes in "Blade 2" from 2002, directed by Guillermo Del
          Toro. Bruce Talamon/New Line/Kobal/Shutterstock Speaking of past comic
          book movie outings, Wesley Snipes’ fierce and vampiric Marvel
          superhero Blade comes back in “Deadpool & Wolverine,” after leading
          his own trilogy of movies back in the late ’90s and early ‘00s – the
          third of which actually costarred Reynolds, which might explain how
          this cameo came to be.</p> <p>Here, Snipes’ Blade becomes part of a ragtag
          team of forgotten heroes – along with Jennifer Garner’s Elektra, who
          for whatever reason was unceremoniously spoiled as a cameo via IMDb
          months ago – that helps the title stars fight the big bad (in this
          case it’s Cassandra Nova, played by Emma Corrin). At one point,
          Snipes’ Blade says that “there’s only been one Blade, and there’s only
          ever gonna be one Blade,” which gives Deadpool pause as Mahershala Ali
          has been tapped to reboot the character in the Marvel Cinematic
          Universe since 2019, in spite of a fair share of delays.</p> <p>Channing
          Tatum as Gambit… finally Channing Tatum on July 11. Channing Tatum on
          July 11. Patricia J. Garcinuno/Getty Images As for those failed
          superhero movie experiments, many remember that long-ago Comic Con
          from 2015 that featured none other than Channing Tatum, who was
          attached to star in a standalone movie about Marvel X-Men superhero
          Gambit, a Cajun card-shark who has the ability to charge objects with
          kinetic energy.</p> <p>Much like Tatum’s accent in the character, the movie
          proved hard to pin down and remained in development purgatory, never
          quite getting off the ground. That is, until now, when Tatum casually
          walks out on screen in “Deadpool & Wolverine” as an additional member
          of Blade and Elektra’s Void-dwelling troupe.</p> <p>Part of what’s so
          surprising about these cameos is their length. Tatum has several
          extended scenes, and true to form, the “Deadpool” scriptwriters (and
          DP/Reynolds himself) make sure to make a good deal of fun of him (and
          honestly, for good reason).</p> <p>The exploding Gambit card effects are
          super cool, though.</p> <p>Henry Cavill as… “Cavillerene”??!! Henry Cavill at
          CinemaCon 2024 in April. Henry Cavill at CinemaCon 2024 in April. Gabe
          Ginsberg/Getty Images The one throwaway but still incredible cameo
          comes earlier in the movie, when Deadpool goes on a multiversal quest
          to find Wolverine and “cues the montage” of variants he comes across.</p>
          <p>One of those versions of Logan is at first seen from behind, rippling
          muscles galore, and is soon to be revealed as Henry Cavill, formerly
          known as Superman. It’s a brief bit in which Deadpool assures him that
          Marvel/Disney will treat him better than “those guys down the street”
          (a subtle dig at DC, who decided not to retain his services as the Man
          of Steel).</p>
