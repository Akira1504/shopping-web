      Japan’s Mount Fuji implements tourist tax in response to overcrowding
      concerns

          <p>Mount Fuji, a UNESCO World Heritage site and an icon of Japan, has put
          new regulations in place for climbers amid concerns about
          overcrowding. Beginning July 1, climbers must pay 2,000 yen ($12.40)
          per person, with a daily maximum of 4,000 climbers per day. “By
          strongly promoting comprehensive safety measures for climbing Mount
          Fuji, we will ensure that Mount Fuji, a treasure of the world, is
          passed on to future generations,” said Koutaro Nagasaki, governor of
          Yamanashi Prefecture, when announcing the new regulations earlier this
          year.</p> <p>“In order to revive traditional mountain climbing from the foot
          of Mount Fuji, we will gain a detailed understanding of the Fuji-ko
          and Oshi culture that supported Mount Fuji worship. We look to link
          these cultures to this mountain climbing, as it is rooted in the
          cultural values of the religion.” Fuji-ko is a religion specific to
          the mountain. Human traffic jams, foothills littered with garbage and
          inappropriately attired hikers – some attempting the ascent in sandals
          - are among the issues plaguing the popular Japanese site.</p> <p>In
          addition, there will be new guides who manage safety on and around the
          trails. They will inform climbers when they’re violating etiquette on
          the mountain, such as sleeping by the side of the trail, starting a
          fire or wearing unsuitable clothing. This 2023 photo shows a crowd of

          people hiked Mount Fuji in 2019, a rise of three million from 2012.</p>
          <p>“Overtourism – and all the subsequent consequences like rubbish,
          rising CO2 emissions and reckless hikers – is the biggest problem
          facing Mount Fuji,” Masatake Izumi, a Yamanashi prefectural government
          official, told CNN Travel last year. In 2023, a volunteer named Tomoyo
          Takahashi told CNN she would ask visitors to voluntarily contribute
          1,000 yen ($6.20) toward maintaining the mountain.</p> <p>“Not everyone pays
          the 1,000 yen, and it makes me sad. There should be a mandatory
          entrance fee that’s much much higher so only visitors who truly
          appreciate Mount Fuji’s heritage come,” she said at the time. Now,
          Takahashi will get her wish. The new rules, though, only apply in
          Yamanashi prefecture, which is where the more popular hiking trails
          are. Fuji is also located in Shizuoka prefecture, which has not yet
          implemented any taxes or visitor limits.</p> <p>Governor Nagasaki told
          reporters that he and the governor of Shizuoka would meet at the end
          of the climbing season to compare notes. Maiko participate in a bean

          Kyoto – and the Japanese city is ready to take action Japan’s tourism
          headaches Overtourism has become a bigger issue in Japan since the
          country reopened following the pandemic.</p> <p>In Kyoto, locals in the
          historic Gion quarter have expressed their concern with tourists who
          flock there to photograph and sometimes harass the geisha who live and
          work there, earning the nickname “geisha paparazzi.” While the city
          has put up signs and placards asking visitors not to photograph
          geisha, some locals told CNN Travel that it wasn’t enough.</p> <p>One
          suggestion offered by the neighborhood council is issuing fines or
          tickets. And the town of Hatsukaichi, in Hiroshima prefecture in
          southwestern Japan, has been affected too. The small town is home to
          the famous orange “floating shrine” torii gate, which is part of a
          1,400-year-old Shinto complex. In October 2023, the town began
          charging 100 yen (62 cents) per visitor to the shrine.</p> <p>The money from
          the “tourist tax” goes toward maintaining the site and its
          infrastructure. Editor’s Note: This story was originally published in
