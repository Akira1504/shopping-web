      Myanmar rebels are claiming their biggest victory yet over junta forces.
      Could it be a turning point in the brutal civil war?

          <p>The pounding of sustained gunfire and artillery had rattled Khin Swe’s
          home in northeastern Myanmar for days, with shelling getting ever
          closer until it was impossible for her to remain. “If I had stayed, I
          would have been dead by now because of artillery firing and airstrikes
          that were falling all over the town,” Khin Swe told CNN, using a
          pseudonym for security reasons. “There was nothing we could do to be
          safe, except to run,” said the 28-year-old online sales rep. Like many
          of the residents of Lashio, a major town of about 170,000 people
          nestled in the mountains of northern Shan state, Khin Swe packed what
          she could and fled. Images published by local media in the past few
          weeks show a mass exodus from the town, with a long line of cars,
          trucks and bikes laden with belongings snaking through muddy,
          monsoon-lashed roads. Since late June, a powerful ethnic rebel army
          and its allied resistance forces have mounted a renewed offensive to
          capture Lashio. The strategic garrison town, the largest in Shan
          state, is the seat of the junta’s regional Northeastern Military
          Command and the center of its power base in Myanmar’s northeast and
          areas near the Chinese border, with about 40 battalions under its
          command. Myanmar has spiraled into a devastating civil conflict since
          the junta’s 2021 coup was overwhelmingly spurned by the people, as the
          military wages a ruthless war against a nationwide armed resistance
          determined to oust it from power.</p> <p>On July 25, the Myanmar National
          Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), a rebel force of the ethnic Chinese
          Kokang minority, announced it had “won a decisive victory” against the
          junta and declared Lashio “fully liberated” following a 23-day
          operation. If confirmed, the capture of Lashio would be the biggest
          victory for the resistance since the coup and mark a turning point in
          the three-year civil war that has been characterized by increasingly
          brutal attacks against civilians by junta soldiers and warplanes, and
          the mass displacement of more than 3 million people.</p> <p>Junta
          spokesperson Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun has repeatedly denied that the town
          and the regional command has been captured, calling the claims
          “propaganda.” The junta said the rebel group has “devastated
          civilians’ areas [rather] than military strategic holds.” Video and
          images posted to social media and on the MDNAA’s accounts in recent
          days appeared to show their troops in central Lashio, including at the
          railway station, prison and a broadcast station, and within hundreds
          of meters of core military infrastructure. CNN cannot independently
          verify the claims from either side. Displaced people fleeing fighting

          Analysts say the situation remains fluid and while the rebel group is
          quickly moving through the town, capturing several battalions
          especially to the south of the city, fighting is ongoing.</p> <p>“That sort
          of position in the very middle of Lashio certainly points toward
          significant gains within the city,” said Nathan Ruser, an analyst at
          the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, who has been mapping
          positions of the resistance in Lashio. For Lashio to fall, “it
          basically eliminates the junta as an effective organized force from a
          huge part of the country,” Ruser said. “And for it to appear to be
          happening after only about a month of clashes shows how much the
          capabilities of the junta have declined in the last year especially.”
          Caught in the crossfire Khin Swe said Lashio’s residents were used to
          the sounds of fighting nearby but not within the city itself.
          “Artillery shelling was fired constantly at night over the town. With
          our phones in our hands to keep updated with the news, we all sat
          anxiously. Some nights, I didn’t dare to sleep as shells roared
          overhead. At some point I fell asleep and was woken up by the sound of
          the loud artillery again,” she said. “It was the scariest moment I
          have ever experienced in my life.” The main forward part of the
          rebels’ assault had focused on the south and west of Lashio, with the
          MNDAA and its allies targeting the LIB 507 military base before
          entering the town and clearing it street by street, analysts and
          residents told CNN. Khin Swe, whose home was close to the base,
          described how shelling started near her part of town but had grown in
          intensity in other areas as the military’s soldiers exchanged fire
          with the rebels. Displaced people cross the Dokhtawaddy river at Zin

          six-hour drive away in normal conditions.</p> <p>Bus fares leaving the city
          had skyrocketed, she said, as droves of people tried to flee. Some of
          her family members decided to stay in Lashio to protect their homes
          and businesses. Before phone lines got cut off, Khin Swe said her
          relatives “saw Kokang troops move into the town and position
          themselves in empty buildings, while they urged the people to leave.”
          “I am sure my home has been wrecked, but we can’t reach out to people
          who are left in the town because the phone connection is cut off,” she
          said. “My friend who had stayed in the town until very recently told
          me that most of the houses have been damaged.”</p> <p>Being among many people
          displaced by war in Mandalay, Khin Swe said she and her family “are
          barely surviving.” “The displacement shelters are full up with the
          entire population of Lashio town, some of us are struggling to find a
          place to live. Besides, we don’t have food to eat either,” she said.
          “Our family could not take some valuable items other than some money,
          and now we are living with more than 30 people in a place we rented.”

          entire town is burning.’ Fires rage as Rohingya caught up on the front
          lines of Myanmar’s civil war Other Lashio residents caught in the
          crossfire have written desperate messages for help on local community
          and neighborhood Facebook groups.</p> <p>“There are children and elderly
          being caught in a high school amid crossfire in Lashio, they have not
          eaten the whole day, I don’t know how to help,” one social media user
          posted. “We are a group of three girls with a 70-year-old grandma, we
          want to leave the town either for Taunggyi or Mandalay, but we are
          struggling with how,” another resident posted, leaving her phone
          number. One man who spoke to CNN by phone said he fled Lashio at 4
          a.m. last Friday as heavy fire raged overhead. “We left the town with
          a bunch of people by truck. The road on the way was badly damaged,” he
          said as he traveled to Taunggyi, the Shan state capital some nine
          hours south of Lashio. The fighting, which has extended across Shan
          state and the neighboring Mandalay region has forced thousands of
          civilians to flee – many of them multiple times – often to towns and
          villages also facing a barrage of junta airstrikes and shelling. The
          deteriorating humanitarian crisis is being exacerbated by a lack of
          food and aid, with local community networks risking their lives to
          reach those in need. Coordination of anti-coup resistance Rebels have
          reportedly seized dozens of junta bases and several northern towns
          since a renewed offensive in late June by the Three Brotherhood
          Alliance, a trio of ethnic armed groups fighting alongside the
          People’s Defence Force (PDF), the armed wing of the national unity
          government in exile.</p> <p>The gains for the rebel alliance – made up of the
          MNDAA, the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and the Arakan Army
          – followed the collapse of a Chinese-brokered ceasefire, according to
          local media and resistance groups. Last week, the TNLA said it had
          captured another strategic town in the Mandalay region – Mogok, the
          center of Myanmar’s lucrative gem mining industry. Analysts say
          resistance forces now control many of the roads to Lashio and other
          key towns in the northeast, preventing the military from resupplying
          soldiers in its peripheral outposts. “They’re unable to push forces up
          because all the roads are controlled by the opposition, so they have a
          hard time sending reinforcements,” said Miemie Winn Byrd, a retired US
          Army Lt. Col. and professor at the Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific
          Center for Security Studies. Since October, the military has been
          weakened by a series of territorial losses, troop defections,
          desertions and loss of manpower. Endemic corruption and poor command
          within its ranks mean the junta leadership may not have a clear idea
          of the situation on the ground across the country, including in
          Lashio, analysts say.</p> <p>People queue for food at a monastery turned

          the corruption, Naypyidaw does not know how many forces it has… they
          have had a lot of desertions and defections that are going
          unreported,” Byrd said. “I’m not sure (junta chief) Min Aung Hlaing
          knows that that city has fallen into the hands of the opposition. I’m
          not sure his people are telling him that.” Last week, the junta
          reportedly replaced the head of the northeast command.</p> <p>There were also
          reports in local media that the junta had ordered its staff to leave
          Lashio as fighting got closer. CNN cannot independently verify these
          claims. In a recent address, junta spokesperson Zaw Min Tun appeared
          to counter claims of a weakened military, which he referred to by its
          local name, the Tatmadaw. “As long as Myanmar exists, the Tatmadaw
          will exist. As long as we exist, Myanmar will live even stronger
          because we will safeguard your lives and your properties. Therefore,
          you all must work hand in hand to defend your country,” he said.

          Burnings and beheadings: Myanmar junta escalates terror tactics
          against its people The anti-coup resistance in Myanmar was once
          considered a loose grouping of ill-equipped fighters, but recent
          successes, including the MNDAA’s push into Lashio, has shown a new
          level of coordination and capability, according to analysts. “This
          phase of Operation 1027 has really shown a new level of
          interoperability and coordination between the ethnic resistance
          organizations and the political PDF resistance,” said Ruser, referring
          to the Three Brotherhood Alliance’s name for its ongoing offensive.</p>
          <p>“Given the sort of snowballing gains by the resistance, and especially
          the Three Brotherhood Alliance over the last six to eight months,
          they’re now a really equipped force. They have artillery, they have
          plenty of drones, they have all sorts of capabilities that now allow
          them to really strike apart at qualified and static positions.” For
          Khin Swe, the fighting in Lashio has left people divided.</p> <p>“Chinese
          people in the town and young people who are in support of revolution
          are largely in favor of the Kokang group while the older generation,
          who don’t want war, blame the Kokang for their territorial invasion
          [and] are in support of the military,” she said. Khin Swe said she is
          “saddened to see the destruction” in her hometown but she supports the
          “revolutionary groups defeating the junta.”</p> <p>“I am happy and sad at the
          same time because I don’t know how we will rebuild our home. But the
          news of Lashio being captured gives us hope that one day in the near
          future we can go back home,” she said.</p>
